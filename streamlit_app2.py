# Data Pre-Processing  
The first step is to pull the data. In our case, We have a Dexcom Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM). Dexcom provides easy access to our data which can be downloaded as a CSV file through Dexcom Clarity.

The important data for us to look at are the DataDtTm and CGM (mg/dL) columns. Every 5 minutes, the CGM acquires a data point, stores it, and displays it to the user.

The mean glucose value over a given period is a straightforward descriptor of overall glycemic control. 

The target range for diabetics is between 70 and 180 mg/dL, with normal (non-diabetic) mean glucose between 90 and 110 mg/dL.

It’s useful to know the percentage of time in various ranges as an indication of the general behavior of CGM variations. As mentioned earlier in the study, the relevant ranges are:

hypoglycemia (BG < 0.7 g/L)

target range ( 0.7 g/L < BG < 1.8 g/L)

hyperglycemia (BG > 1.8 g/L)

Over this 30 day period,  BG values were in range ~91% of the time. We would prefer this number to be higher, but it will never be perfect. 

Ultimately, a higher TIR correlates to a lower risk for microvascular complications .

 TIR should be considered in combination with lab-derived A1C values to accurately assess the day-to-day glucose variations.

We  have only been able to find a few examples for TIR goals. Diabetes.org specifies a goal of at least 70% TIR, but We personally feel that is too low. 

Suffice to say, the higher the TIR, the better.

# Glucose Trace
The glucose trace graph is simply a time series of BG values.

 It’s useful to visualize the fluctuations in BG levels over time, to determine if there are any trends throughout the day.

I wrote the following code to create a Plotly interactive graph that has buttons to change the display region.

 For example, clicking “1d” will change the window to display only one days worth of data. Similarly, “1m” will change the view to encompass one month of data. 
 
 From there, you can scrub back and forth to see how the BG values fluctuate over time:
